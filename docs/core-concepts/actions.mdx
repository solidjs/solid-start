<Title>Actions</Title>

One question you will likely have when developing any sort of app is "how do I communicate new information to my server?". Solid's answer to this is _actions_. Actions give you an asynchronous function and elegant tools to help you easily manage and track submissions. They generally represent a `POST` request.

Actions are isomorphic. This means that a submission can be handled on the server _or_ the client, which ever is optimal. They represent the server component of a [HTML form](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), and even help you use HTML forms to submit data.

## Creating actions

Let's stop getting ahead of ourselves! First let's create an action!

```tsx twoslash
// @lib: ES2015
import { createRouteAction } from "solid-start/data";

export function MyComponent() {
  const action = createRouteAction(async (message: string) => {
    // Imagine this is a call to fetch
    await new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    console.log(message);
  });
}
```

This echo action will act as your backend, however you can substitute it for any API, provided you are ok with it running on the client. Typically, route actions are used with some sort of solution like fetch or graphql, and return either a `Response` such as a redirect (we are not returning anything quite yet!) or any value. If you want to ensure the action only runs on the server for things like databases, you will want to use a different function explained below.

Naturally, this action won't do anything quite yet. We still need to call it somewhere! For now, let's call it manually from some component using the `submit` method.

```ts twoslash {3,8}
// @lib: ES2015
import { createRouteAction } from "solid-start/data";
export function MyComponent() {
  const action = createRouteAction(async (message: string) => {
    // Imagine this is a call to fetch
    await new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    console.log(message);
  });
  action.submit("Hello from solid!");
}
```

You should see `Hello from solid!` back in the console!

### Returning from actions

In many cases, after submitting data the server sends some data back as well. Anything returned from your action function can be accessed using the reactive `action.value` property. The value of this property can change each time you submit your action.

```tsx twoslash {2,4,7-9}
// @lib: ES2015
import { createRouteAction } from "solid-start/data";
// ---cut---
export function MyComponent() {
  const action = createRouteAction(async (message: string) => {
    await new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    return message;
  });

  action.submit("Hello from solid!");
  setTimeout(() => action.submit("This is a second submission!"), 1500);
  return <p>{action.value}</p>;
}
```

While this method of using actions works, it leads the implementation details of how you trigger `action.submit` up to you. When handling explicit user input, it's better to use a form for a multitude of reasons.

#### Responses

// Todo

SolidStart provides a number of functions to make creating responses easy. They can be imported from `solid-start/server`

##### redirect

##### json

##### eventStream

##### ResponseError

## Using forms to submit data

We highly recommend using HTML forms as your method to submit data with actions. HTML forms can be used even before JavaScript loads, leading to instantly interactive applications. They have the added benefit of implicit accessibility, and can save you valuable time that would have otherwise been spent designing a UI library that will never have the aforementioned benefits.

When forms are used to submit actions, the first argument is an instance of [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData). Writing forms using actions is trivial, simply use the `Form` method of your action instead of the normal `<form>` tag, and walk away with amazing, progressively enhanced forms!

If you don't return a `Response` from your action, the user will stay on the same page and your resources will be retriggered. You can also return a `redirect` or `ResponseError`.

```tsx
export function MyComponent() {
  ...
  return (
    <action.Form>
      <label for="username">Username:</label>
      <input type="text" name="username" />
      <input type="submit" value="submit" />
    </action.Form>
  );
}
```

The only difference between `action.Form` and a normal form is that `action.Form` calls the action as it's submit handler automatically.

## Retriggering resources

- retriggers route resources

## Errors

- Errors, error field that's populated if the submission errored, and a status field that's set to `error`
  - if you read the `submissionState.error` field in your code (JSX, or effects) then the error is considered user-handled and we don't trigger ErrorBoundaries.
  - if you don't use the error field, then we trigger the error boundary on an error because we assume its unexpected for you
- How to do form errors? Where to put... Here or `ResponseError`?

## Server Actions

Sometimes we need to make sure our action *only* runs on the server. This is useful for:

- accessing internal APIs
- proxing external APIs
  - To use server secrets
  - To reduce the response payload by postprocessing
  - To bypass CORS
- running code incompatible with browsers
- or even connecting directly to a database (Take caution, opinions on if this is a good idea are mixed. You should consider separating your backend and frontend.)

To do this, simply replace `createRouteAction` with `createServerAction` and the action will always be run on the server.
