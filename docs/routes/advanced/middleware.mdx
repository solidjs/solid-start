# Middleware

Middlewares may be included by passing file you specify in your start config.

```js
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";

export default defineConfig({
  start: {
    middleware: "./src/middleware.ts"
  }
});
```

Inside the middleware file, you can export a `createMiddleware` function.

```tsx
import { createMiddleware } from "@solidjs/start/middleware";

export default createMiddleware({
  onRequest: [
    event => {
      console.log("GLOBAL", event.request.url);
    }
  ]
});
```

Middleware supports 2 lifecycles: `onRequest` and `onBeforeResponse`. If you return a value from middleware it will respond with that, otherwise it will run the next one in the chain.
