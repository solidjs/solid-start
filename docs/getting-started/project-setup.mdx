## Using a starter (recommended)

To create your first SolidStart application, create a directory, change into that directory, and initalize `solid@next`.

```bash
# npm
mkdir my-app && cd my-app
npm init solid@next
# pnpm
mkdir my-app && cd my-app
pnpm create solid@next
```

You will get a list of templates from which to choose. You can view the code for each of these options in the [SolidStart repository](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start/tree/main/examples).

```bash
? Which template do you want to use? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   bare
    hackernews
    with-auth
    with-mdx
    with-tailwindcss
    with-vitest
```

Next, you'll be asked whether to use Server Side Rendering and TypeScript. Choose your desired options to continue.

Now that the appropriate template has downloaded, you can install dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
# pnpm
pnpm install
```

Your app is now set up! You can run it locally by running

```bash
# npm
npm run dev
# pnpm
pnpm dev
```

Your application should now be running locally on port 3000. You can view it by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Project files

When you look inside your new application directory, you should see a file structure similar to this:

```
node_modules/
public/
src/
├── routes/
│   ├── index.tsx
├── entry-client.tsx
├── entry-server.tsx
├── root.tsx
```

**Note:** Your file extensions may vary slightly if you chose different configuration options in the previous step.

To get our bearings, let's quickly review what each directory and file does in this structure:

- **node_modules/** - the `node_modules` directory contains any third-party dependencies added to your project.
- **public/** - the `public` directory contains publically-available assets (images, styles, fonts, etc.) for your application.
- **src/** - the `src` directory is where most of your SolidStart application code will live.
- **src/routes/** - this is where your file routes/pages will be located. We'll go into more detail about routing in later sections!
- **src/entry-client.tsx** - the `entry-client.tsx` file is what loads and _hydrates_ the JavaScript for our application on the client side (in browser). In many cases, you won't need to modify this file.
- **src/entry-server.tsx** - the `entry-server.tsx` handles requests on the server. In many cases, you won't need to modify this file.
- **root.tsx** - this is the HTML root of your application both for client and server rendering. You can think of this as the shell inside which your application will be rendered.
